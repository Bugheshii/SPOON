Little game I (and some internet friends) made, a lot like DOOM '93 but it's done in my own way. PLZ dont strike me it's a school project T_T

Created THE game itself, tried to implement textures of walls but did't read the code through (was on macOS, it gave me cancer). 

                                                                    !!BUGS!!

-  When you die, the restart freezes everything
-  When you win, if you click on restart it freezes everything (again)
-  Damage taken not clear
-  No bullet when you fire
-  Door texture = horrible
-  The clicker is hidden on the main menu but when you go over the new game it shows, same thing on the you win and game over menus

                                                                !!Improvements!!

-  better HUD
-  random map every time you start the game
-  more floors and more levels
-  better sprites and textures
-  .EXE instead of .html? possible with TAURI, but need to know how, maybe YT or AI?
